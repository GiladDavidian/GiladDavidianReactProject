                <h2 className="about-subtitle">Core Functionality</h2>
                <p className="about-description">
                    At its heart, the application is built to retrieve and display a comprehensive collection of business cards with efficiency and clarity. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its primary capabilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dynamic Data Fetching:</strong> The application connects to a robust external API endpoint (
                        <a href="https://monkfish-app-z9uza.ondigitalocean.app/bcard2/cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="about-link">
                            https://monkfish-app-z9uza.ondigitalocean.app/bcard2/cards
                        </a>
                        ) to fetch business card data in real-time. This ensures that you always have access to the most current information available, directly from the source.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Intuitive Display:</strong> Each retrieved business card is meticulously presented in a clear, organized format. You can effortlessly browse through cards, with each one showcasing essential details at a glance:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Visual Representation:</strong> An image, often a company logo or a personal photo, provides immediate visual recognition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Identification:</strong> The cardholder's name (as the **title**) and their professional role or company (as the **subtitle**) are prominently displayed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct Contact Information:</strong> Essential contact details like phone numbers and physical addresses are readily accessible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unique Identifier:</strong> A specific **business card number** provides a unique reference for each card, useful for internal tracking or quick recall.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seamless User Experience:</strong> We've prioritized a smooth and responsive user experience. During data loading, a visual indicator (managed through a global loading state via React Context API) is activated. This keeps you informed that information is being retrieved, preventing uncertainty and providing clear feedback during network operations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="about-subtitle">Technologies Under the Hood</h2>
                <p className="about-description">
                    Our application is built on a solid foundation of cutting-edge web development technologies, ensuring performance, maintainability, and scalability for future enhancements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>React.js:</strong> The entire user interface is constructed using **React**, a leading JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive web applications. React's powerful component-based architecture allows for modular, reusable code, making the application efficient, scalable, and easy to extend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>React Hooks:</strong> We extensively utilize React Hooks like `useState` for managing component-specific data (e.g., the array of business cards) and `useEffect` for handling side effects such as asynchronous data fetching when the component mounts. This approach simplifies state logic and lifecycle management.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Context API:</strong> For seamless state management across different parts of the application, especially for global concerns, we employ React's **Context API**. This is particularly useful for managing the application's loading state (`setIsLoader`), allowing disparate components to communicate and share data without the complexity of prop drilling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fetch API:</strong> Data communication with the external server is handled by the native **Fetch API**, providing a modern, promise-based, and efficient way to make asynchronous network requests and handle responses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CSS Styling:</strong> The application's clean visual appeal and responsive design are achieved through dedicated CSS files. This modular approach to styling ensures a consistent, aesthetic, and user-friendly look across various devices and screen sizes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
